Known issues:

* Counter-Strike: Condition Zero can't be played for some reason.
  This will hopefully be fixed soon.

* You can't launch Hammer or any other tool from Source SDK Launcher.
  Please launch your tools directly! To do that efficiently...

  - You'll need to copy config\ folder
    and ClientRegistry.blob file to both bin\ep1 and bin\orangebox

  - You'll need to copy bin\SteamApp.cfg to both bin\ep1\bin and
    bin\orangebox\bin

  - You'll need to launch tools from bin\ep1 and bin\orangebox
    as a starting directory, respectively for two engine types.

  - this applies to x86 (32-bit) Operating Systems only!
    Problems should not appear on 64-bit systems! 
    However, either way, you will need to copy BLOB files.
